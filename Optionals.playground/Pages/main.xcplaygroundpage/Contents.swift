/*: question1
 ### 1. What is the type of the variable `pet` declared below?
 */
var pet = "turtle üê¢"
//String





/*: question2
 ### 2. What is the type of the variable `petName` declared below?
 */
var petName: String?


//String: Optional



/*: question3
 ### 3. Currently, what is the _value_ of `petName`?
 */

// It doens't have one - nil





/*: question4
 ### 4. Give `petName` a value! Assign to it any string. What is its type now?
 */
// write your code here


petName = "Howell"

//Still String: Optional



/*: question5
 ### 5. Print out `petName` using Swift's `print()` function. What do you expect to see in the console?
 */
// write your code here


//I expect and error, a nil, or a ?

print(petName)

//"Optional("Howell")"





/*: question6
 ### 6. Write an if statement that only prints `petName`'s value if it is not `nil`. If `petName` is `nil`, print, "There is no pet name." What do you expect to see in the console?
 */
// write your code here
if petName == nil {
    print("There is no pet name.")
} else {
    print(petName)
}






/*: question7
 ### 7. Use _optional binding_ to unwrap the value of `petName` and print it to the console without all the **Optional(...)** stuff around it.
 */
// write your code here

if let petName = petName {
    print(petName)
}




/*: question8
 ### 8. Write an if statement that will print out "The value of anotherPetName is nil" using the variable below
 */
var anotherPetName: String?
// write your code here

if anotherPetName == nil {
    print("The value of anotherPetName is nil")
} else {
    print(anotherPetName)
}


/*: question9
 ### 9. Using optional binding, write an if statement that prints "anotherPetName has no value" if it is `nil`; otherwise, print the _unwrapped_ value of `anotherPetName`. What do you expect to see in the console?
 */
// write your code here

if anotherPetName != nil {
    if let anotherPetName = anotherPetName {
        print(anotherPetName)
    } else {
        print("anotherPetName has no value")
    }
}






/*: question10
 ### 10. Declare a _constant_ optional string (using the `let` keyword). Then try to assign a string value to it on the next line. Print out the constant. What happens?
 */
// write your code here
let dandy: String?
dandy = "dan"
print(dandy)
//Optional("dan")








/*: question11
 ### 11. Declare another _constant_ optional string, and set it to `nil` immediately. Then, on the next line, assign a string value to it. What happens?
 */
// write your code here

//let scotty: String? = nil
//scotty = "scott"
//Xcode freaks out: many warnings at once
